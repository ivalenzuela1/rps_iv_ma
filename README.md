Work with your partner to create a game of Rock Paper Scissors that runs until one player has three wins

Store the player names and number of wins for each player in variables
Use a while loop to run the game until one player has 3 wins
Use this starter code to randomly select an item:
var weapons = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'];
var weaponOfChoice =
    weapons[Math.floor(Math.random() * weapons.length) % 3];
// your code goes here
Output each player's hand to the console
Use an if or switch statement to determine a winner of the round
Output the round winner's name to the console
Create a way to track how many rounds each player has won
When one player wins 3 rounds, announce that player's name as the game winner
Email me a link to your REPL or push the code to our class GitHub Organization
See below for all possible winning outcomes
